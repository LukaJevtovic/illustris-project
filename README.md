# illustris-project
An astrophysical data science project regarding the morphology and statistics of galaxies generated in the Illustris simulations.

## Requirements
Below is the list of libraries used in this project. It is possible that everything is reproducible with different versions, but this hasn't been tested.
* requests 2.31.0
* h5py 3.12.1
* matplotlib 3.8.2
* Pillow 10.2.0
* Python-IO 0.3

At least 200MB of free hard drive space is recommended, more depending on the workflow.

## Getting Started

An Illustris API key is necessary for the vast majority of this project. You can visit the [Official Illustris Documentation](https://www.illustris-project.org/data/docs/api/) and follow the instructions there in order to create an account and get your API key. The documentation also contains many examples and code snippets (some of which were used in this project) that can help familiarize with the API navigation.

If your API key is required in the code, it will be noted as the API_KEY_HERE token.
